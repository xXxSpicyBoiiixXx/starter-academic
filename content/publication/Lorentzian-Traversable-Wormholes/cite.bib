ABSTRACT = {The curvature invariants of three Lorentzian wormholes are calculated and plotted in this paper. The plots may be inspected for discontinuities to analyze the traversability of a wormhole. This approach was formulated by Henry, Overduin, and Wilcomb for black holes (Henry et al., 2016). Curvature invariants are independent of coordinate basis, so the process is free of coordinate mapping distortions and the same regardless of your chosen coordinates (Christoffel, E.B., 1869; Stephani, et al., 2003). The four independent Carminati and McLenaghan (CM) invariants are calculated and the nonzero curvature invariant functions are plotted (Carminati et al., 1991; Santosuosso et al., 1998). Three traversable wormhole line elements analyzed include the (i) spherically symmetric Morris and Thorne, (ii) thin-shell Schwarzschild wormholes, and (iii) the exponential metric (Visser, M., 1995; Boonserm et al., 2018).},
