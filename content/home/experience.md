  - title: PhD Research Aide 
    company: Argonne National Laboratory

    description: Working under Dr. Yuri Alexeev to find a optimal tensor contraction on Argonne-developed tensor network quantum simulator QTensor. This invovles in developing a parallel optimizer written in Julia to find an optimal tensor contraction sequenes for large problems requiring running on Polaris and Aurora supercomputers. The overall goal is to find the optimal tensor contraction sequences for quantum supremacy Sycamore and QAOA quantum circuits to demonstrate quantum advantage.

    description: Currently, researching in the HExSA labs at Illinois Institute of Technology under the advisement of Dr. Kyle Hale. In the HExSA lab, the various reserach projects that I am invovled in are in regards to distributed computing, operating systems, and programming languages. I also work under Dr. Stefan Muller, where we utilized WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) such as OTAWA and RAML that analyzed ARM binaries with OCaml programs that effectively generates an approximation of code execution timing in higher level languages such as Python, C++, etc. This provides a cost effective way of looking at higher level lanuage's computation times without having to actually run them or have possible errors that may arise to be looked at manually that may end up saving costs. In addition, this included verfication of sequential and concurrent programs. This automation are comparable to manually checking each case inside OCaml programs and we are currently working on explaing this work for various programs. I am also running simulations using the Sniper platform for dynamic enivornments with remote cores as well as in edge computing cases where I am currently leveraging programming language techniques and using custom made virtual machines as a test bay to simulate a highly dynamic network. This consits of utilizing a custom interpreter with a stack machine to be able to calculate the cost in a real world scenario.  
  - title: Graduate Student Researcher
    company: Illinois Institute of Technology

    description: Researched cyber crimes regarding human trafficking and child predators analyzing their methods of encryption and steganography techniques to conduct their criminal activities under the advisement of Mr. Louis McHugh IV. Conducted a mini research project into supply chain attacks, where he conducted a case study into the various methodology that make a supply chain attack successful. This required analyzing a number of major cyber breaches from Equifax, Target, and various ATMs in Eastern Europe.

    description: Mini research project utilizing C++ to theoretically calculate and model the decay of cube satellites in the atmosphere. This resulted in constructing a GUI interface to make the program user friendly. This included having weekly meetings to discuss about the project and current astrophysics phenomenons that may have any affect on the cube satellites.

    description: Published a research paper regarding general relativist invariants of black holes, worm holes and the Alcubierre metric. Computer programming and direct mathematical analysis is applied. Utilize C++, Python, and analyzed FORTRAN code to complete our paper. Hand calculated tensors to make sure the computer code was giving the correct values. Utilized R to investigate the theory of negative probability and quasi-distributions.
