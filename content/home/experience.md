    description: Researching in the HExSA labs at Illinois Institute of Technology under the advisement of Dr. Kyle Hale. In the HExSA lab, the various research projects are in regards to distributed and parallel computing. Researching a spectral analysis for the detection of malware inside software. This includes utilizing python and assembly code to detect irregulars within software dynamically to immediately expose malware. Leverage non-volatile main memory to perform to dynamic remote access memory as if it was the same memory storage. This research project resulted is that produced an effective runtime architecture. Ultimately, the findings of were that we were able to avoid the memory bandwidth between DRAM and CPU, also know as the von Neumann Bottleneck. My personal research is in quantum information and cryptography. This consists of deterministic open-quantum-system dynamics, quantum measurements, and quantum error correction.

    description: Researched cyber crimes regarding human trafficking and child predators analyzing their methods of encryption and steganography techniques to conduct their criminal activities under the advisement of Mr. Louis McHugh IV. Conducted a mini research project into supply chain attacks, where he conducted a case study into the various methodology that make a supply chain attack successful. This required analyzing a number of major cyber breaches from Equifax, Target, and various ATMs in Eastern Europe.

    description: Mini research project utilizing C++ to theoretically calculate and model the decay of cube satellites in the atmosphere. This resulted in constructing a GUI interface to make the program user friendly. This included having weekly meetings to discuss about the project and current astrophysics phenomenons that may have any affect on the cube satellites.

    description: Published a research paper regarding general relativist invariants of black holes, worm holes and the Alcubierre metric. Computer programming and direct mathematical analysis is applied. Utilize C++, Python, and analyzed FORTRAN code to complete our paper. Hand calculated tensors to make sure the computer code was giving the correct values. Utilized R to investigate the theory of negative probability and quasi-distributions.
