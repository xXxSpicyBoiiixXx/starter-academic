I am currently a Ph.D. Computer Science student at [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu). I am working in the laboratory for [high-performance, experimental systems and architecture (HExSA)](https://github.com/HExSA-Lab), where I am being advised by [Dr. Kyle Hale](https://www.halek.co) and [Dr. Stefan Muller](http://cs.iit.edu/~smuller/). My main research endeavors is to explore the intersections between operating systems and programming languages.  My research interests are in operating systems, programming languages, quantum computing, and theoretical computer science. My background extends to physics, mathematics, and cybersecurity and this has brought me into a broad range of research interests in the field of computer science. I am fluent in English, Russian, Bengali, and I am currently learning Chinese.

I recieved my M.S. in Applied Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics from [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu) in 2020 under the advisement of [Dr. Louis McHugh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louismchugh/). During my undergraduate career, I recieved two B.S. degrees in Phyiscs and Applied Mathematics from [Texas State University](https://www.txstate.edu) in 2019 where I worked under [Dr. Blagoy Rangelov](https://blagoyrangelov.com) and [Dr. Gerald Cleaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_B._Cleaver).
