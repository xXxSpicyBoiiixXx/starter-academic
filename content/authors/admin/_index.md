I am a dedicated Cybersecurity Consultant at Burwood Group Inc., with a primary focus on conducting penetration testing engagements across diverse sectors, including healthcare, education, and financial institutions. Specializing in offensive security techniques and defensive operations, I thrive on uncovering vulnerabilities within systems and networks to fortify our clients' defenses against cyber threats.

In addition to my expertise in penetration testing, I am deeply committed to implementing Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) practices. By integrating GRC principles into our security strategies, I ensure that our clients not only identify vulnerabilities but also establish robust governance frameworks to mitigate risks effectively and maintain compliance with regulatory standards and industry best practices.

Beyond my professional role, I am passionate about sharing my cybersecurity expertise. As a part-time instructor at ThriveDX, I have the privilege of imparting knowledge to others, helping them navigate the evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Additionally, serving as an adjunct professor at both Illinois Institute of Technology and Saint Louis University has deepened my understanding of technology while mentoring undergraduate and graduate students.

Education has been a cornerstone of my journey. I hold dual Master's degrees from the Illinois Institute of Technology, one in Computer Science and the other in Applied Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics. My academic pursuits were guided by esteemed mentors, shaping my understanding of cybersecurity intricacies. Prior to this, I earned Bachelor of Science degrees in Physics and Applied Mathematics from Texas State University, where I honed my analytical skills under the guidance of respected professors.

My diverse educational background, coupled with extensive hands-on experience in cybersecurity, positions me as a valuable asset to any organization. I am driven by a constant pursuit of knowledge and am currently undertaking PhD endeavors to deepen my expertise further.

Outside of the professional realm, I am an avid language learner and musician. Fluent in English, Russian, and Bengali, I am currently expanding my linguistic horizons by studying Chinese and Tagalog. Music is my sanctuary, with over a decade of experience playing the violin, six years mastering the bass guitar, and exploring the intricacies of piano.
