I am currently employed as a Cybersecurity Consultant at [Burwood Group Inc.](https://burwood.com), where I am responsible for implementing GRC practices and conducting pen-testing across various sectors such as healthcare, education, and financial institutions. Alongside my professional commitments, I impart my knowledge of Cybersecurity concepts as a part-time instructor at [ThriveDX](https://thrivedx.com), with an emphasis on offensive security, defensive operations, and GRC principals. Moreover, I am an adjunct professor at [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://iit.edu), which has helped me to acquire a deeper understanding of this field.

I hold two Masters's degrees from the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://iit.edu). The first, in Computer Science, was obtained in 2022 under the guidance of [Dr. Kyle Hale](https://www.halek.co) and [Dr. Stefan Muller](http://cs.iit.edu/~smuller/), whereas the second, in Applied Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, was obtained in 2020, and I was advised by [Dr. Louis McHugh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louismchugh/). Prior to this, I earned two Bachelor of Science degrees in Physics and Applied Mathematics from [Texas State University](https://www.txstate.edu) in 2019, where I worked under [Dr. Blagoy Rangelov](https://blagoyrangelov.com) and [Dr. Gerald Cleaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_B._Cleaver). My extensive educational background and vast experience in the field of Cybersecurity make me a valuable asset to any organization as well as my current PhD endeavors.

In my leisure time, I like to learn new languages and play musical instruments. I am fluent in English, Russian, and Bengali and am currently learning Chinese and Tagalog. My musical background is nothing short of impressive, having played the violin for eleven years, the bass guitar for six years, and dabbled in piano as well.
